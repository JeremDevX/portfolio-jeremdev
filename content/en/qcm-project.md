## Description

Personal project of a QCM application allowing the creation of user accounts, the creation of questionnaires and the possibility of answering them. The objective was to design a database (PostgreSQL) managed via an ORM (Prisma) as well as a server ensuring communication with it. A simple front-end interface was created to allow interaction with the application. An authentication system was also implemented to secure the routes, allowing the creation and response to a QCM only once connected.
