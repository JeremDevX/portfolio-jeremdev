## Description

This project was carried out as part of the OpenClassrooms training. The objective was to integrate the front-end of a real estate rental application based on a Figma mockup and a file of simulated data in JSON. The technological constraints required the use of React and Sass. The site had to be responsive and offer smooth navigation between the different pages, while taking into account errors with a dedicated 404 page.

## Technologies

List of technologies used:

- React (with react-router-dom)
- Sass
- Typescript
- ViteJs
