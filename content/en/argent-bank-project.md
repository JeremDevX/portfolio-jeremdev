## Description

Front-end integration project of a banking application, carried out as part of the OpenClassrooms training. A front-end interface has been developed from mockups, integrating a global store to retrieve data from a database and access it throughout the application. Authentication routes have been set up to communicate securely with the back-end and allow a user to log in. In addition, I created a database via a headless CMS (Strapi) to enrich the project. For simplicity, the data on Strapi has not been secured and has access.

## Technologies

List of technologies used:

- React (with react-redux)
- Node.js
